Introduction / Business Problem
A friend of mine who lives in Manhattan, KS told me recently that she wants to start a food and board games amusement center in her city (Manhattan, KS). Manhattan is a college city that has many well-known bars, but some believe that there is not enough family-friendly activities in the city. I want to see what kinds of amusement activities are available in order to advise her whether opening a food and board game center is a good idea or not. I will need to research the population characteristics of the city and compare it to the currently available amusement activities to see if there is a market for her idea. Additionally, I will compare the city venues and population characteristics to other "family-friendly" cities to see what types of venues are missing in Manhattan.

I will pull and organize venue information and population data for Manhattan, KS and three other cities that are considered "family-friendly". Venue information will come from Foursquare. The population information will come from the 2010 Census data. Acknowledging that the 2010 census is 10 years old, I will proportionally increase the population percentage by the best estimator I can find for each city to more closely match the actual current populations. I will compare the population categories (age groups, median income, etc.) to see how well the Manhattan populace resembles the other cities. Then I will analyze the venue information of the four cities to see what Manhattan is missing. Depending on what venues are missing or underrepresented that she is able to fulfill (such as bakery, non-alcoholic drinks, board games, etc.), I will advise my friend accordingly.
